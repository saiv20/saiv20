### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing my Master's in Robotics. My interests primarily lie in Motion Planning and Computer Vision.

A significant portion of my previous experiences involved leveraging Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python to design and implement solutions.
